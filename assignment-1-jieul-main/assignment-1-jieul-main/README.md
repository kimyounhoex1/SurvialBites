# Homework 1. SQL Lab

## Overview
In this project, your task is to construct a set of SQL queries for analyzing a database that will be provided to you. For this, we use the MySQL sample database (i.e., classicmodels) which is already shown in the chapter 5. This project opens up opportunities 1) learn basic and advanced SQL features, and 2) get familiar with using commercial open-source DBMS engine, MySQL which is useful for your career.


## Instruction

This project contains 8 problems in total and graded out of 100 points. You should construct SQL query that fetches desired data as state in each problem. Your answer for each problem must contain only one statement.  
For this, we use the MySQL using the docker (Please use the MySQL 8.0.33 version) and follow the below instructions.


## Problmes

See this [PDF](hw1.pdf) file.
